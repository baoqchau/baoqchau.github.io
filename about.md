Hello there. Thanks for checking out my blog.
 
I am Bao Chau, a software engineer at [AppFolio](https://www.appfolioinc.com). I graduated from [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu) in December 2018. I work mainly in Ruby on Rails and React but also know Python and Java. I am interested in Machine Learning and web development. When I'm not near a keyboard, I am probably biking or doing [photography](https://www.flickr.com/people/baoqchau/). 

Feel free to get in touch with me by shooting me an email :).
